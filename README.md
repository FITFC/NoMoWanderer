# NoMoWanderer
Minecraft mod that adds various blocks and items that prevent Wandering Trader spawns.

## No Soliciting Sign
Block that prevents Wandering Trader spawns within a configurable distance (in chunks) of the block.

Min=1, Max=8, Default=4

### Recipe
The current recipe follows that of a normal sign, except you need to put green dye in the bottom left corner and red dye in the bottom right corner of the crafting grid. You get 3 signs from the craft.

## Totem of Unexchange
Item that, when in either a Baubles slot or your inventory, will prevent Wandering Trader spawns around the player.

## Future Plans
Next up for the mod will be to add an item that you carry to prevent the spawn. More than likely it will integrate with Baubles so that it will not have to use up an inventory slot.
