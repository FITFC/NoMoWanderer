# NoMoWanderer
Adds a block called `No Soliciting Sign` that prevents Wandering Trader spawns within a configurable distance of the block.

## Recipe
The current recipe follows that of a normal sign, except you need to put green dye in the bottom left corner and red dye in the bottom right corner of the crafting grid. You get 3 signs from the craft.

## Future Plans
Next up for the mod will be to add an item that you carry to prevent the spawn. More than likely it will integrate with Baubles so that it will not have to use up an inventory slot.
