# NoMoWanderer
Minecraft mod that adds various blocks and items that prevent Wandering Trader spawns.

## No Soliciting Sign
Block that prevents Wandering Trader spawns within a configurable distance (in chunks) of the block.

### Recipe
The current recipe follows that of a normal sign, except you need to put green dye in the bottom left corner and red dye in the bottom right corner of the crafting grid. You get 3 signs from the craft.

## Totem of Unexchange
Item that, when in a Baubles slot, Curios slot, or anywhere in your inventory, will prevent Wandering Trader spawns around the player. The distance is the same used for the No Soliciting Sign.
